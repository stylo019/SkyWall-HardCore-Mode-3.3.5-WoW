# [SkyWall](https://skywall.org) Hardcore Mode (3.3.5 WoW) (Béta)

[SkyWall](https://skywall.org) Hardcore Mode is a mod for the game World of Warcraft (version 3.3.5) that introduces a Hardcore game mode for players seeking an extra challenge. In this mode, players face tougher challenges, and if they die, they lose valuable items or get kicked from a special Hardcore guild.

## Key Features

- Hardcore Mode: Players can enable Hardcore mode when creating a character, which brings more severe consequences upon death.
- Item Loss: When players die, they lose a precious item called "Immortal" that cannot be recovered. A global announcement is made on death for all the HC players.
- HC Guild Ejection: Players can be kicked out of a special Hardcore guild upon death, depriving them of special perks and features.
